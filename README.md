# COBRA.models
Set of models used for testing COBRA code in continuous integration environments

These models are only to be used for testing of COBRA code. They are not meant to be verified versions of particular models. For that, always go to the original distribution source. 

For example, although there are versions of human metabolic reconstructions in this repository, e.g., ReconX, one should not use these versions as the basis for downstream calculations as they are only supposed to be used with test code. Go to an original distribution source for ReconX instead, e.g., https://www.vmh.life/#downloadview
